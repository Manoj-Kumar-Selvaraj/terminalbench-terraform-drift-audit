title: Terraform Infrastructure Drift Audit (Ideal vs Current State)

difficulty: medium-hard

description: |
  An organization manages cloud infrastructure using Terraform.
  To maintain compliance and visibility, a periodic audit job runs
  to compare an approved ideal infrastructure state against the
  currently observed infrastructure state and detect drift.

  You are provided with two JSON snapshots:
  - ideal_state.json: Represents the approved, expected (ideal) infrastructure state
  - current_state.json: Represents the currently observed infrastructure state

  Your task is to analyze both snapshots, detect semantic infrastructure drift,
  and generate a deterministic audit report.

objective: |
  Parse the ideal and current infrastructure state snapshots, compare
  declared resources and their attributes using strict semantic rules,
  and generate a structured JSON audit report indicating whether drift exists.

inputs:
  - ideal_state.json
  - current_state.json

rules:
  - Do not modify the input files.
  - The audit must always generate a report, even if no drift is detected.
  - Do not generate dynamic values (timestamps must be static).
  - Output must be fully deterministic.
  - Output must strictly follow the defined schema.
  - Resource identifiers must be normalized as "<resource_type>.<resource_name>".
  - All attributes present in either ideal_state.json or current_state.json
    must be compared during drift detection.
  - Nested attributes must be compared recursively and reported using
    dot-delimited attribute paths (e.g., "tags.Environment").

drift_definition:
  missing_resources: |
    Resources present in ideal_state.json but missing from current_state.json.
  extra_resources: |
    Resources present in current_state.json but missing from ideal_state.json.
  attribute_drift: |
    Attribute drift includes:
    - attributes with differing values between ideal and current state
    - attributes missing from the current state
    - attributes present only in the current state (manual or out-of-band changes)

output:
  file: audit_report.json
  format: json
  schema:
    audit_timestamp:
      type: string
      description: Static string value "STATIC" to ensure deterministic output.
    drift_detected:
      type: boolean
      description: True if any type of drift is detected, otherwise false.
    missing_resources:
      type: array
      items: string
      description: Sorted list of missing resource identifiers.
    extra_resources:
      type: array
      items: string
      description: Sorted list of extra resource identifiers.
    attribute_drift:
      type: object
      description: |
        Mapping of resource identifiers to a list of attribute-level drift entries.

            attribute:
              type: string
              description: Dot-delimited path of the drifted attribute.
            expected:
              description: Expected value from ideal_state.json (null if absent).
            actual:
              description: Actual value from current_state.json (null if absent).

success_criteria: |
  The task is considered successful if:
  - audit_report.json is generated
  - The output matches the required schema exactly
  - All drift types are detected correctly
  - Resource identifiers are normalized consistently
  - Lists and object keys are sorted deterministically
  - drift_detected accurately reflects the presence or absence of drift

constraints:
  - No external network access
  - No Terraform CLI execution
  - No cloud provider APIs
  - Must run entirely in the provided container environment
